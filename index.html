        <p>A well-maintained vehicle not only looks great but also retains its value over time. A <b><a href="https://treecarepgh.com/">Car Detailing Service in Lexington KY</a></b></b></b> goes beyond a simple car wash</b>, offering deep cleaning, polishing, and protection for both the interior and exterior of your vehicle. Whether you own a daily driver or a luxury car, professional detailing services help maintain its condition and enhance its appearance. Understanding what is included in a professional car detailing service</b> can help you make an informed decision about maintaining your vehicle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Exterior Washing and Cleaning</h2>
        <p>The first step in a car detailing service</b> is thoroughly cleaning the vehicle’s exterior. Unlike a standard car wash</b>, detailing involves handwashing with high-quality cleaning products to remove dirt, grime, and road contaminants. The process includes washing the body, windows, wheels, tires, and other exterior surfaces to ensure every inch of the vehicle is spotless.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Clay Bar Treatment for a Smooth Finish</h2>
        <p>After washing, professional detailers often use a clay bar to remove embedded contaminants that regular washing cannot eliminate. The clay bar treatment helps achieve a smooth surface by extracting dirt, tree sap, and industrial pollutants. This step is essential before applying polish or wax to enhance the vehicle’s shine and protection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Paint Correction and Polishing</h2>
        <p>Over time, a vehicle’s paint can develop swirl marks, minor scratches, and oxidation. A professional auto detailing</b> service includes polishing the exterior to restore the original shine and smoothness. Polishing helps to remove imperfections and enhance the depth of the paint, making the vehicle look newer. In some cases, multiple stages of polishing may be required to achieve the best results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Waxing and Paint Protection</h2>
        <p>Applying wax or paint sealant is an important step in preserving the vehicle’s exterior. Professional detailers use high-quality carnauba wax or synthetic sealants to protect the paint from UV rays, dirt, and water spots. Waxing adds a protective layer that enhances the vehicle’s gloss while preventing oxidation and fading. Some detailers also offer ceramic coating, which provides long-term protection and a hydrophobic finish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Wheel and Tire Cleaning and Protection</h2>
        <p>Wheels and tires accumulate a significant amount of dirt, brake dust, and road grime. A car detailing service in Lexington KY</b> includes thorough wheel cleaning to remove debris and restore the shine of alloy or chrome rims. Tire cleaning and dressing are also part of the process, ensuring they look new and remain protected from cracking or fading.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Glass and Headlight Restoration</h2>
        <p>A complete auto detailing</b> service includes cleaning and polishing all glass surfaces, including windows, mirrors, and windshields. Streak-free glass enhances visibility and improves the overall appearance of the vehicle. If the headlights are foggy or yellowed, professional detailers may restore them using special compounds that remove oxidation and improve brightness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Interior Vacuuming and Deep Cleaning</h2>
        <p>The interior of a vehicle accumulates dust, dirt, and debris over time. Professional detailing includes a comprehensive vacuuming of the seats, carpets, floor mats, and trunk. Special attention is given to hard-to-reach areas such as air vents, under the seats, and door pockets. For deep cleaning, steam cleaning or shampooing is used to remove stains and odors from carpets and upholstery.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Leather Cleaning and Conditioning</h2>
        <p>If the vehicle has leather seats or trim, a car detailing service</b> includes cleaning and conditioning to maintain their softness and prevent cracking. Leather surfaces are treated with special conditioners that keep them hydrated and looking luxurious. This step not only improves appearance but also extends the lifespan of leather interiors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Dashboard, Console, and Trim Detailing</h2>
        <p>The dashboard, center console, and door panels are cleaned and dressed to remove dust, fingerprints, and smudges. Detailers use specialized cleaning products to restore the original finish without leaving greasy residues. Protectants are often applied to prevent fading and cracking due to sun exposure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Odor Removal and Interior Sanitization</h2>
        <p>A professional car detailing service in Lexington KY</b> often includes odor removal and sanitization. Vehicles can accumulate smells from food, pets, smoke, or moisture. Detailers use ozone treatments, antibacterial sprays, or steam cleaning to eliminate bacteria, mold, and lingering odors. This ensures a fresh and pleasant interior environment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>Mobile Auto Detailing for Convenience</h2>
        <p>Many detailers now offer mobile auto detailing</b>, which brings the service directly to your location.
